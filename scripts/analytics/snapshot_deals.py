"""
Weekly (or nightly) snapshot of open pipeline deals into deals_snapshot.

INVARIANTS:
1. Point-in-time correctness: Every field in deals_snapshot is the value
   as of snapshot_date, never current state from a later date.

2. Inclusion rule: A deal belongs in the snapshot for date D if:
   - created_date <= D, AND
   - the deal had not reached a terminal (won/lost) stage as of D

   Shared with Method 2 via point_in_time.is_deal_open_at_date so the two
   cannot diverge. This replaced a close_date test. close_date is a forecast
   that slips, and an open deal whose close_date has passed is still open.
   Measured on FY2027 Q3 with both arms reconstructed point-in-time, the
   close_date test dropped 13-15 in-scope deals per week sitting in Review,
   Discovery or Scoping with close dates up to 962 days past, while the two
   rules disagreed the other way on exactly one deal across all four dates -
   a Closed Lost deal carrying a future close_date, which the terminal test
   judges correctly.

3. Scoping is NOT applied here. Every pipeline and stage is written on
   purpose: the renewal pipeline is `analyze: false` for the MEDDICC agent
   but analytics INCLUDES it for GRR/NRR, so scoping the writes would destroy
   those rows. Scope on read, never on write.

Idempotent — running twice same day upserts, not duplicates.
Must be run AFTER etl_deals.py --mode analytics so the deals table is current.
