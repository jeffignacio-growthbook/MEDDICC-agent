-- Score corrections: a rep's structured disagreement with a MEDDICC component
-- score (FIX_MEDDICC_SCORING_PIPELINE, Part 7).
--
-- This is a REVIEW QUEUE, never a live score source — same discipline as the
-- proposals table (036): the agent proposes a score, a human disposes. Nothing
-- here auto-adjusts a component score. Two purposes:
--   1. a rep who can push back stops treating the tool as an accusation;
--   2. we accumulate labelled examples of where the generator is wrong — the
--      only real training signal available.
