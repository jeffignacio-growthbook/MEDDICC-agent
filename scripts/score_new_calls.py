"""
Daily incremental call scoring (PROGRESSIVE_SCORING_SPEC, Phase 5b).

Runs at the tail of daily-calls-etl, right after resolve_calls has linked the
night's new calls to deals. It scores only the NEW (not-yet-scored) calls and
upserts their call_scores deltas — so the progressive roll-up is current each
morning without re-running the whole backfill.

Cumulative-context scoring means a new call's score depends on the deal's rolled
state THROUGH the calls before it. So this does not score calls in isolation:

  * For a deal with new calls that all come AFTER its already-scored calls
    (the normal case — a fresh call from last night), it reconstructs the prior
    rolled state from the stored call_scores rows and folds only the new calls
    forward, threading that state. Old calls are not re-scored.

  * If a new call lands BEFORE an already-scored call (a late/back-dated
    transcript), the append is unsafe — the fold order changed — so that deal is
    re-folded in full (correctness over cost). Full re-scores are also what the
    backfill does; this only decides WHEN a full re-fold is needed.

Idempotent: a deal whose scoreable calls are all already scored at the current
scorer_version is skipped. Reuses backfill_call_scores' loaders so there is one
book-loading + one fold implementation.

Env:
  DRY_RUN=1              report what would be scored; no model calls, no writes
  SCORING_MODEL_ROLE=... LLMClient role (default 'generator'=Sonnet)
  SCORE_DEAL_IDS=a,b,c   restrict to these deals
  SCORE_LIMIT=N          cap number of deals with new calls to process
Needs SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY (+ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unless DRY_RUN).
