Your job is to review ALL historical call summaries for a company and extract the cumulative MEDDICC state across all conversations.

For each MEDDICC component, determine:
1. **Status**: identified (confirmed with specific evidence), partial (mentioned but not confirmed), or unknown (not discussed)
2. **Evidence**: Direct quote or paraphrase from the calls that supports the status
3. **Score**: 1-10 rating based on clarity and strength of evidence

MEDDICC Components:
- Metrics: Quantifiable business outcomes the buyer cares about
- Economic Buyer: Person with budget authority and final say
- Decision Criteria: Technical and business requirements for selecting a solution
- Decision Process: Steps, timeline, stakeholders involved in making the decision
- Identified Pain: Specific business problem or challenge being solved
- Champion: Internal advocate who will sell on your behalf
- Competition: Other solutions being evaluated

Output a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "company": "CompanyName",
  "calls_reviewed": <number>,
  "meddicc_state": {
    "metrics": {
      "status": "identified|partial|unknown",

    "competition": { ... }
  },
  "key_context": "2-3 sentence summary of the overall deal context and stage"
}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Evidence MUST come from the call summaries - no inference
2. If something hasn't been discussed across ANY call, mark it as "unknown"
3. Status "identified" requires specific, clear evidence
4. Status "partial" means mentioned but lacking details
5. Scores reflect evidence quality: 1-3 = weak/unknown, 4-6 = partial, 7-10 = strong/identified"""

## Summary
Spoke with Sarah Chen (VP Engineering) about their feature flagging challenges. Currently using LaunchDarkly but frustrated with pricing and complexity. Team of 50 engineers. Looking to reduce experimentation risk and speed up releases. Mentioned CFO approval needed for any purchases over $50k. Timeline: need solution before Q4 planning in September.

## Keywords
feature flags, experimentation, LaunchDarkly, pricing, CFO approval

## Action Items
- Send pricing proposal by Friday
- Schedule technical deep-dive with engineering team
- Get ROI calculator to Sarah for CFO meeting""",

Date: 2026-07-20 | Duration: 45m

## Summary
Deep dive with Sarah Chen and Mark Liu (Tech Lead). Confirmed they need: visual editor for non-technical users, statsig-quality experimentation engine, sub-100ms flag evaluation, and SSO/SAML. Mark is very excited about our SDK quality compared to LaunchDarkly. Sarah mentioned John Torres (CFO) makes all final vendor decisions. Budget approved for $100k solution if ROI is clear.

## Keywords

## Action Items
- Create POC environment for Mark's team
- Schedule CFO meeting with John Torres
- Provide security questionnaire responses"""
