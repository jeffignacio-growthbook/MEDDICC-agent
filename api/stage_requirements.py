"""
Stage-aware MEDDICC requirements for deal risk assessment.

Loads stage progression requirements from config/client.yaml and provides
helpers to determine which components are expected at each stage.

Design: Stage requirements are derived from config ONLY, never hardcoded.
Uses stage.order to map to stage_progression entries, making this work
for any client's stage IDs/names without code changes.
