## CRITICAL RULES

### 1. Use Cumulative State
- If the cumulative state shows something is "identified", DO NOT mark it as a gap
- Carry forward evidence from previous calls - don't re-discover what's already known
- Only flag as unknown if it's not been discussed on ANY call to date

### 2. Evidence-Based Only
- Every status claim must be backed by specific evidence from calls
- Quote directly or paraphrase closely - no inference
- If not mentioned in calls, status = Unknown

### 3. Status Definitions
- **✅ Identified**: Confirmed with specific evidence (score 7-10)
- **⚠️ Partial**: Mentioned but lacking key details (score 4-6)
- **❌ Unknown**: Not discussed on any call (score 1-3)

### 4. Next Steps Must Be Specific
- Include WHO (person name/title)
- Include WHAT (concrete action, not "follow up")
- Include WHEN (timeline or next meeting)
- Bad: "Follow up on budget"
- Good: "Ask Sarah Chen (VP Eng) about budget approval process with CFO John Torres on Friday's call"

### 5. Scores Must Reflect Evidence Quality
- 9-10: Crystal clear, multiple confirmations
- 7-8: Clear evidence, single confirmation
- 5-6: Partial information, needs clarification
- 3-4: Vague mention, significant gaps
- 1-2: Not discussed or unknown

### 6. No Hallucination
- Only use information from the provided call summaries
- Don't infer titles, names, or details not explicitly stated
- If unclear, mark as Partial and flag what to clarify

### 7. Integrate Call and Cumulative State
- Recent call may update or confirm cumulative state
- If recent call contradicts cumulative state, recent call wins (more current)
- Synthesize: recent call + cumulative state = complete picture

## Examples of Good vs Bad

### ❌ Bad - Hallucinated Evidence
**Metrics**
Status: ✅ Identified
Evidence: "Customer wants to improve conversion rates and reduce churn"
[This is generic and not from the actual call]

### ✅ Good - Specific Evidence
**Metrics**
Status: ✅ Identified
Score: 8/10
Evidence: "Sarah mentioned they lose $500k annually to failed experiments. Quote: 'If we can cut our failed experiment rate from 40% to 20%, that's a quarter million in savings.'"

### ❌ Bad - Ignores Cumulative State
**Economic Buyer**
Status: ❌ Unknown
Next steps: Ask who has budget authority

[Cumulative state already identified John Torres as CFO/Economic Buyer in previous call]

### ✅ Good - Uses Cumulative State
**Economic Buyer**
Status: ✅ Identified
Score: 9/10
Evidence: "John Torres (CFO) confirmed as final decision maker in Call #2. Sarah mentioned 'John needs to see clear ROI before approving' in today's call, reinforcing his authority."

### ❌ Bad - Vague Next Steps
Next steps: Follow up on timeline

### ✅ Good - Specific Next Steps
Next steps: Ask Sarah Chen on Friday's technical review: "Walk me through the exact steps from our POC completion to contract signature. Who reviews the security questionnaire? When does legal get involved?"
