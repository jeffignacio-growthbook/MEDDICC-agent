# RevOps Agent Environment Setup

Walk through each credential in sequence. Explain where to find each one
before asking. Validate format before proceeding. At the end, output two
artifacts: the Railway .env file and the GitHub Secrets checklist.

Never ask for multiple credentials at once. One at a time keeps errors
out and makes it easy to pause and come back.

## Step 1 — Anthropic API Key

Tell the user:
"First we need your Anthropic API key. This is what powers Claude.
To get it: platform.anthropic.com → API Keys → Create Key
Format: starts with sk-ant-"

Ask: "Paste your Anthropic API key:"
Validate: must start with sk-ant-

## Step 2 — Call intelligence platform credentials

First check config/client.yaml for the call_tools.primary setting.
If it's 'gong', collect Gong credentials. Otherwise, collect Fireflies.

### If using Gong (call_tools.primary = 'gong'):

Tell the user:
"You're configured to use Gong for call intelligence.
To get your credentials:
1. Go to: Gong → Settings → Company Settings → API
2. Create a new Technical User or use existing
3. You'll need: Access Key and Access Key Secret

Gong API docs: https://gong.app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation"

Ask: "Paste your Gong Access Key:"
Store as: GONG_ACCESS_KEY

Ask: "Paste your Gong Access Key Secret:"
Store as: GONG_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET

### If using Fireflies (call_tools.primary = 'fireflies' or not set):

Tell the user:
"You're configured to use Fireflies for call intelligence.
To get it: app.fireflies.ai → Integrations → API → copy the key"

Ask: "Paste your Fireflies API key (or SKIP):"
Store as: FIREFLIES_API_KEY

## Step 3 — Apollo API Key

Tell the user:
"Apollo is used for video call recordings.
Note: this is the meeting recorder, not the sales intelligence tool.
To get it: your Apollo workspace → Settings → API"

Ask: "Paste your Apollo API key (or SKIP):"
Store as: APOLLO_API_KEY

## Step 4 — HubSpot Private App Token

Tell the user:
"HubSpot is your CRM. The agent reads active deals and writes
MEDDICC scores back as deal properties.

To get it:
1. HubSpot → Settings → Integrations → Private Apps
2. Required scopes: crm.objects.deals.read, crm.objects.deals.write,
   crm.objects.contacts.read, crm.objects.companies.read,
   timeline, timeline.read, timeline.write
3. Copy the access token (starts with pat-na1-)

Important: rotate this token if it was ever in a public repo."

Ask: "Paste your HubSpot private app token:"
Validate: should start with pat-

## Step 5 — Supabase credentials

Tell the user:
"Supabase is the query database for the Slack agent.
Go to: Supabase dashboard → your project → Settings → API
You need two things: Project URL and service_role key (not anon)."

Ask: "Paste your Supabase Project URL:"
Validate: must start with https:// and end with .supabase.co

Ask: "Paste your Supabase service_role key:"
Validate: starts with eyJ

## Step 6 — GitHub repository

Ask: "Enter your GitHub repo (owner/repo-name):"
Example: acme/AI_for_revops_lecture_6

## Step 7 — Zapier catch hook URL

Tell the user:
"This is the Zap 2 catch hook URL — skip if not set up yet."

Ask: "Paste your Zapier catch hook URL (or SKIP):"

## Step 8 — Generate outputs

Write a .env file to the repo root with all collected values.

Then print the GitHub Secrets checklist:

GitHub Secrets — Environment: Agent

□ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
□ FIREFLIES_API_KEY         (blank if using Gong)
□ GONG_ACCESS_KEY           (blank if using Fireflies)
□ GONG_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET    (blank if using Fireflies)
□ APOLLO_API_KEY            (blank if skipped)
□ HUBSPOT_API_KEY
□ SUPABASE_URL
□ SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
□ ZAP_RESPONSE_URL          (blank if skipped)

Fastest way to add them:
  gh secret set --env Agent --env-file .env

Note: GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_REPO are automatic — do not add them.

Tell the user: "Credentials done. Now run the context onboarding:
say 'start client onboarding'"
