## ✅ Recently Completed

### Region + Segment Waterfall Segmentation (2026-09-08)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All 4 steps verified

**Completed Work:**
- [x] Schema changes: Added region and segment columns to waterfall_weekly
- [x] Updated primary key to (week_ending, pipeline_id, region, segment)
- [x] Created compute_waterfall_segmented.py with region/segment grouping
- [x] Applied is_test_deal() hygiene filter (1 test deal filtered)
- [x] Registered both columns in data_dictionary as queryable
- [x] Full historical backfill: 934 segmented rows across 55 weeks
- [x] Added synthesis prompt instruction for question-substitution flagging

**Results:**
- 55 weeks of segmented history (2025-08-11 to 2026-09-07)
- Region distribution: NAM 218, EMEA 175, APAC 165, LATAM 145, UNKNOWN 128, ROW 103
- Segment distribution: SMB 292, Enterprise 232, Mid-Market 228, Unknown 182
- EMEA latest: Enterprise $2.2M, Mid-Market $1.1M, SMB $880K, Unknown $50K

**Verification Passed:**
1. ✓ EMEA pipeline query returns full waterfall (beginning/ending/won/lost/net change)
2. ✓ Historical trend plausible: $1.7M (Aug 2025) → $4.2M (Sep 2026)
3. ✓ Data dictionary registration confirmed for both columns

**Commits:** b4f1765 (waterfall segmentation), 6aee7ae (synthesis pattern)

### Test Data Hygiene (2026-09-08)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Implement `is_test_deal()` function (commit b8f63eb)
- [x] Wire into `filter_table()` for automatic exclusion (commit fd2c29e)
- [x] Test patterns: "Test"/"Test Org", "-test", "test-", " test", "teste"
- [x] Legitimate companies excluded: TestGorilla, User Testing Inc, Testbirds

**Coverage:** 11 test deals (0.58% of database) now auto-excluded from all dynamic_query results

**Documentation:** TEST_DATA_HYGIENE_RULE.md

## 📋 Backlog

### Low Priority

#### 1. Zero-Day Cycle Time Deals
**Issue:** 4 deals with negative or zero cycle time (data quality artifacts)

**Impact:** Low (already filtered by `is_valid_cycle_deal()` in handlers, but exist in raw data)

**Work:** Investigate and clean up at source (HubSpot or ETL)

**Complexity:** Low effort

---

#### 2. Forecast Analysis Bugs (Status Unconfirmed)
**Issue:** 2 old bugs mentioned in forecast_analyses.py

**Work:** Confirm if still present, fix if needed

**Complexity:** TBD (need to confirm existence first)

---

## 📝 Notes

### Patterns Established

**Data Hygiene Rules:**
All follow same discipline: **filter at data layer, not silently in metrics**
- `is_valid_cycle_deal()` - excludes negative cycle times
- `is_fresh_pipeline_deal()` - excludes stale deals (>180 days)
- `is_incremental_pipeline()` - distinguishes pipeline from renewal base
- `is_test_deal()` - excludes test/demo data ✅

**Data Dictionary Registration:**
Schema changes for query handlers require data_dictionary registration:
1. Add column to database schema
2. Populate with data
3. Register in `data_dictionary` with `is_queryable=True`

Without step 3, LLM query builder cannot see the column exists.

### Related Issues

**Same "exists but not applied" gap pattern:**
- property_history implementation (existed, not used)
- coaching config (existed, not used)
- is_test_deal() (existed, NOW WIRED - commit fd2c29e)

**Lesson:** When implementing new functions/configs, immediately wire them into the handlers that should use them. Don't let them sit as "tested-but-unused" code.

## 🔄 Process

**To add new work:**
1. Document the issue (what/why/impact)
2. Design the fix (what changes needed)
3. Estimate complexity
4. Add to appropriate priority section
5. Create detailed .md file if needed (like TEST_DATA_HYGIENE_RULE.md, REGION_WATERFALL_GAP.md)

**When starting work:**
1. Move item to "In Progress" section
2. Add date started
3. Create task tracking if multi-step

**When completing work:**
1. Move to "Recently Completed" section
2. Add completion date
3. List commits
4. Note any documentation created
5. After 30 days, archive to separate COMPLETED_WORK.md file

## 📊 Summary

**Total Open Items:** 2
- Low Priority: 2 (zero-day cycle times, forecast bugs)

**Recently Completed:** 2
- Waterfall region + segment segmentation (2026-09-08)
- Test data hygiene (2026-09-08)

**Major Milestone:** Region-segmented waterfall now live with 934 historical rows across 55 weeks, enabling accurate EMEA/APAC/LATAM/NAM pipeline reporting by company size segment.
