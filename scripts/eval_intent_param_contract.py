"""
Eval: the classifier's output schema and the handlers' expected params agree.

WHY (FIX_DYNAMIC_FALLBACK_PATTERN follow-up):
query_rep_pipeline failed not only for missing name resolution but because of a
CONTRACT DRIFT: build_intent_prompt tells the classifier to emit `rep_email`,
while the handler read `owner_email`. A correctly-classified request with a
resolved email still fell through — straight into the budget-burning dynamic
loop. Nothing verified that the two contracts agree.

This test enforces the invariant: every param the intent prompt instructs the
classifier to EMIT must be a param that SOME handler (or the router) actually
READS. A param emitted but read nowhere is dead contract — a latent bug the
day a handler is expected to honour it.

Direction is emitted ⊆ read. The reverse is fine: handlers legitimately read
params the classifier never emits (deal_ids / company_names come from thread
entity-scope; owner_email is the resolved form of rep_email; score/component
come from other paths).
