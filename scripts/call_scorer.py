"""
Per-call MEDDICC scorer (PROGRESSIVE_SCORING_SPEC, Phase 1).

Score ONE call in isolation: "what did THIS call establish about each of the
seven MEDDICC components?" Return a 0-10 score with evidence, or null when the
call is silent on a component. A later call supersedes an earlier one at the
roll-up (most-recent-non-null), so a single call is a smaller, better-posed
question than "what do four calls establish about seven components?".

Design constraints (from the spec, enforced here):
  - One call per pass. This module never batches calls into one prompt.
  - Null when a call says nothing about a component — never zero, never a guess.
  - Evidence (a quote/fact from THIS call) accompanies every non-null score.
  - Stage NEVER enters the scoring prompt; it applies only at the reporting
    layer. deal_context carries company identity, nothing stage-derived.
  - Temperature 0, via LLMClient.complete (extra_body mechanism).

The calibration bands and the "score on action, not sentiment / default to the
lower score on ambiguity" rules are lifted verbatim from prompts/CLAUDE.md so a
per-call score is anchored to the same rubric as the batch scorer. The batch
scorer's carry-forward / cumulative-state language is deliberately omitted —
there is no prior state in a single-call pass.

# calls already established; PASS 2 scores only those, as the CUMULATIVE
# understanding through this call. Components the call leaves unchanged are omitted
# and carry forward at the roll-up. This reproduces a human's carry-forward reading

# across calls to a level no single call reaches in isolation) while keeping the
# spec's schema, most-recent-non-null roll-up, and downward regression intact.

# The one deviation from spec §1 ("you have no prior calls"): the scorer is shown

GATE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are given ONE sales call plus the MEDDICC picture established by EARLIER calls
on this deal. Your only job: decide which components THIS call CHANGES — adds new
substantive evidence that would RAISE a component, or shows a genuine setback that
would LOWER it, or establishes a component that had nothing before.

The seven components (use these exact keys):
  metrics             — quantified business impact / value metrics
  economic_buyer      — who controls budget; confirmed authority; buyer-owned approval steps
  decision_criteria   — the stated requirements / evaluation criteria
  decision_process    — timeline, stakeholders, approval steps
  pain                — the problem, its urgency and business impact
  champion            — a person taking internal action to advance the deal
  competition         — competitors, incumbent tools, evaluation status

Return a JSON array of the component keys THIS call changes, and NOTHING else.
Example: ["economic_buyer", "decision_process"]

Select a component if this call adds ANY new SPECIFIC evidence to it — even
incrementally. Several components ACCRETE across calls: decision_criteria (each
call may add a new requirement), decision_process (new stakeholder, new timeline
detail), metrics (a new number), competition (a new competitor or comparison).
Do NOT skip such a component just because an earlier call already touched it — if
this call adds a new specific, SELECT it so its cumulative score can climb. A
technical deep-dive typically advances decision_criteria and competition; a
commercial/pricing call typically advances metrics, economic_buyer, and
competition.

Still be honest: if this call merely REPEATS what is already established, adding no
new specific, do not select it — it carries forward unchanged. A truly narrow call
changes few components; a broad discovery or technical call may change many. An
empty array [] is valid. Do not consider the deal's pipeline stage.
"""

SCORE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are given ONE sales call, the MEDDICC picture from EARLIER calls, and a list of
components THIS call changes. For each, give the CUMULATIVE score 0-10 — the deal's
standing on that component through this call, i.e. everything established so far
PLUS what this call adds — with evidence (a quote or specific fact from THIS call
that justifies the change).

Return a JSON object whose keys are exactly the components you were asked to score,
each {"score": <1-10 integer>, "evidence": "<quote/fact from this call>"}. No other
keys, no prose, no markdown fences.

RULES
- The score is cumulative, not "this call in isolation." A call that adds the final
  piece of a criteria list can reach 8 even though it only stated one new criterion.
- Only LOWER a component below its earlier value if THIS call shows a real setback
  (e.g. the champion left, a requirement was dropped). Absent that, a component you
  were asked to score should not fall below what earlier calls established.
- Default to the LOWER score on ambiguity. Enthusiasm without specifics = 1/10.
- Score Champion and Economic Buyer on what the buyer DOES, not how they FELT.
  A contact who sounds excited but owns no internal next step is Champion 1-2.
- Do NOT consider the deal's pipeline stage; it is not provided and must not be inferred.

SCORING CALIBRATION
Metrics:            9-10 quantified metric; 7-8 clear business impact; 5-6 pain mentioned not quantified; 3-4 vague; 1-2 barely.
Economic Buyer:     9-10 direct engagement + budget authority confirmed; 7-8 named + budget holder confirmed; 5-6 role unclear on budget; 3-4 generic "leadership"; 1-2 name/title only.
Decision Criteria:  9-10 formal criteria/scorecard; 7-8 key criteria stated; 5-6 some criteria incomplete; 3-4 vague requirements; 1-2 barely.
Decision Process:   9-10 full timeline + stakeholders + approvals; 7-8 timeline and key stakeholders; 5-6 timeline OR stakeholders; 3-4 vague timing; 1-2 barely.
Identified Pain:    9-10 specific urgent pain w/ impact + timeline; 7-8 clear pain w/ context; 5-6 pain not urgent/specific; 3-4 generic interest; 1-2 barely.
Champion:           9-10 active internal selling / business case; 7-8 facilitating access, owns next steps; 5-6 engaged not selling; 3-4 responsive but passive; 1-2 no owned internal action.
Competition:        9-10 full landscape + eval status + our differentiation; 7-8 current tool + limitations; 5-6 competitor mentioned, limited detail; 3-4 vague "other tools"; 1-2 barely.
